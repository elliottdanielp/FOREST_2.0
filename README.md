# OVERVIEW    
FOREST_2.0 will bridge the gap between FOREST and JobBOSS. Think of FOREST 2.0 and JobBOSS as partners. We will be able to track a job from start to finish from the time the original BID was won and the BOM was ordered to the time the CUL was placed on the unit and placed on the truck. We will have the ability to run reports in a fashion we currently simply can't. We will be able to run modules that can predict when we will have a certain scope or how many we will have in a given time. We can also find and predict certain trends with the ability of being able to add things like the Sales pipeline tracker directly into FOREST 2.0 Also with the two working in unison we can truly incorporate the Freight Calculator into the bidding process.
